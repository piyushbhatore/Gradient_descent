# Linear_Regression
This ist the basic implementation of gradient descent from scratch
## main.py
This file comtains the code for implementing the gradient descent in 4 different ways
#### 1. without regularisaiton
#### 2. regularisaiton with p = 1.25
#### 3. regularisaiton with p = 1.5
#### 4. regularisaiton with p = 1.75
## output
There are 4 output files corresponding to each type of gradient descent
## data
This folder contains the training and testing data
FEATURE ENGINEERING/LAMDA SELECTION:-
I have done feature engineering in some alternate file.
and used it to tune lambda
came to conclusion that lamda = 1 is best although lambda -ve was givning the minimum error.
