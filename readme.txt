COMPARISION:-
both of them give approximate answer
but the difference cannot get zero because the grad disscent is unable to give as accurate answer as L2 closed from solution
The result are same because in both we minimise tthe squared error

FEATURE ENGINEERING/LAMDA SELECTION:-
I have done feature engineering in some alternate file.
and used it to tune lambda
came to conclusion that lamda = 1 is best although lambda -ve was givning the minimum error.
